## Repositories & Distribution

VeroRun ships as **two repositories** with **two distribution modes**:

| | `verorun-code` | `verorun-pro` |
|---|---|---|
| **Type** | Private repository | Public repository |
| **Usage** | Official site, enterprise customization | Standard enterprise package, open download |
| **URL** | `https://github.com/fanjumin/verorun-code` | `https://github.com/fanjumin/verorun-pro` |
| **Content** | Full source (all built-in plugins, license & unified auth) | Streamlined core export (plugins installed from store) |
| **Install** | SSH access + `install.sh` (Development type, `INSTALL_TYPE=development`) | One-line `curl \| bash` or HTTPS `git clone` |

`verorun-pro` is generated automatically from `verorun-code` on every version tag by the `sync-to-base` CI workflow, using `git archive` plus the `.gitattributes` export rules.

## Quick Start

### Deploy `verorun-pro` (public, open download)

One-command install on a fresh Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 server:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fanjumin/verorun-pro/master/deploy/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- install your-domain.com
```

Or via git clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fanjumin/verorun-pro.git
cd verorun-pro
sudo bash deploy/install.sh install your-domain.com
```

### Deploy `verorun-code` (private, official / enterprise customization)

Access requires SSH access to the private repository. Override `GIT_REPO` so `install.sh` pulls from `verorun-code` (add the server's deploy key to GitHub on first run):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fanjumin/verorun-code.git
cd verorun-code
sudo env GIT_REPO=git@github.com:fanjumin/verorun-code.git bash deploy/install.sh install your-domain.com
```

By default `install.sh` uses **HTTPS** against the public `verorun-pro` repository (`GIT_REPO=https://github.com/fanjumin/verorun-pro.git`) — **no SSH key is required**. For private-repo deployments, use the **Development** install type (`INSTALL_TYPE=development`), which defaults `GIT_REPO` to the private `verorun-code` over SSH.

#### Region Selection

For deployments in China, use the `--region` flag to route API calls to domestic endpoints:

```bash
sudo bash deploy/install.sh install your-domain.com --region=cn
```

Supported values: `cn` (China mainland, routes to `api.verorun.cn`) or `global` (default, routes to `api.verorun.com`).

The install script provisions PostgreSQL, creates the `verorun` system user, sets up a Python virtual environment, generates `.env` with auto-generated secrets (including `PLUGIN_LICENSE_SECRET`, `CAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`, `DEV_ACCOUNTS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `LICENSE_SERVER_SECRET`, `PROBE_SECRET`), creates systemd services (main / auth / admin / health / guardian), configures Nginx, and runs database migration + seed so the deployment is usable right away.

For detailed instructions, see [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md).

### Local / LAN Deployment (no domain required)

For local development, testing, or LAN access **without a public domain**, use the unified installer with an install type. One-command install (no git required — the script auto-fetches `deploy/lib/common.sh` from verorun-pro when run via pipe):

```bash
# 1) Professional — Local / LAN deployment (public verorun-pro, no SSH key required)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fanjumin/verorun-pro/master/deploy/install.sh | sudo env INSTALL_TYPE=professional bash

# 2) Development — full source incl. plugins (private verorun-code, requires SSH deploy key)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fanjumin/verorun-pro/master/deploy/install.sh | sudo env INSTALL_TYPE=development bash
```

Equivalent local invocation (from a checkout):

```bash
# Interactive menu — select type (1=Website, 2=Professional, 3=Development, 4=Educational)
sudo bash deploy/install.sh install

# Or deploy from a local source copy (Development type, no git clone required)
sudo bash deploy/install-code.sh --src /path/to/code
```

- **`Professional` type** — deploys VeroRun without a public domain, accessible via `http://localhost/` (main site), `http://localhost/admin/` (admin panel), `http://localhost/auth/` (user console), or `http://<LAN-IP>/` for LAN access. Uses `DEPLOY_PROTOCOL=http` (no SSL) and Nginx path routing only (no subdomains). Online payment, OAuth, and SMS are unavailable because they require public callback URLs.
- **`Development` type** — the same no-domain deployment from the private `verorun-code` over SSH, but with **all plugins included**. `install-code.sh` remains available as a standalone shortcut (supports `--src` / `--from-tar` for local source / tar deploys).
- **`Educational` type** — no-domain deployment requiring an educational deployment code (ED-XXXX) verified against the license service.

> **Note:** Deployments do not auto-install or auto-enable plugins (`PLUGIN_AUTO_INSTALL=0` by default). Enable the plugins you need manually in the Admin panel after deployment.

### Post-Install

`install` mode already runs database migration + seed automatically (admin account, plans, products are created during install), so the deployment is usable right away. The commands below are only needed in specific cases:

```bash
# Re-seed initial data (admin account, plans, products) after an update if needed
sudo bash deploy/install.sh seed

# Configure domain (if skipped during install)
sudo bash deploy/install.sh configure-domain your-domain.com

# Set up SSL
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com -d platform.your-domain.com -d admin.your-domain.com
```

### Docker Deploy

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The Docker image bundles all services (Nginx, app, Supervisor) into a single container exposing port 80. Volumes mount `data/`, `admin/static/`, and `main_site/static/` directories for persistence. See [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) and [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) for details.

### Local Development

Install dependencies and configure `.env` (a `.env.example` template is not shipped; see [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md) for the required variables), then run each service directly in its own terminal:

**Terminal 1 — Main site / Auth (8081):**

```bash
python auth_server.py
```

**Terminal 2 — User console (8083):**

```bash
python main_site/app.py
```

**Terminal 3 — Admin panel (8084):**

```bash
python admin/app.py
```

**Terminal 4 — Health service (8085):**

```bash
python health_service/app.py
```

Local URLs: `http://localhost:8081/` (official site / unified login), `http://localhost:8083/` (user console), `http://localhost:8084/admin/login` (admin panel).

## VeroGuard — Unified Guardian Daemon

VeroGuard is the unified guardian daemon that merges health monitoring, copyright protection, and remote management into a single process. It runs as an independent systemd service (`verorun-guardian`) on every deployed instance.

| Integrity | `modules/integrity.py` | SHA256 file verification against AES-GCM encrypted manifest |
| Fingerprint | `modules/fingerprint.py` | Multi-dimensional device fingerprinting (MAC, CPU serial, disk serial) |
| Runtime | `modules/runtime.py` | Debugger/ptrace/suspicious module detection, environment variable tampering |
| Communicator | `modules/communicator.py` | AES-256-GCM encrypted, HMAC-SHA256 signed heartbeat with TLS 1.3 + anti-replay |
| Executor | `modules/executor.py` | Remote command execution (6 actions: warn, lock_ai, lock_full, shutdown, self_destruct, update_config) |
| Self-Protect | `modules/self_protect.py` | Dual-process anti-deletion: guardian and self_protect mutual monitoring |

### Remote Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `warn` | Display warning message to user |
| `lock_ai` | Disable all AI features |
| `lock_full` | Put entire site into maintenance mode (503) |
| `shutdown` | Terminate all services gracefully |
| `self_destruct` | Remove guardian daemon files |
| `update_config` | Update runtime configuration parameters |

### Deployment

The guardian is compiled to a standalone binary using Nuitka for production deployment:

```bash
python veroguard/compile/build_guardian.py
# Output: veroguard/dist/verorun-guardian.bin
```

Systemd service files are provided in `veroguard/systemd/`:
- `verorun-guardian.service` — Main daemon
- `verorun-guardian-snapshot.service` + `.timer` — Daily integrity snapshot

### Server-Side (Official Use Only)

The VeroGuard Server components run exclusively on VeroRun's official infrastructure:
- **Database Schema** — 5 PostgreSQL tables in `veroguard` schema: `probe_instances`, `integrity_violations`, `remote_commands`, `probe_heartbeats`, `alert_events`
- **Migration Tool** — `veroguard/tools/migrate_veroguard.py` creates the schema
- **API Endpoints** — Integrated into auth-center for heartbeat reception, command issuance, and alert management

---

## Health Service (v2.0)

The Health Service is an independent Flask service on port 8085, decoupled from the admin panel (8084) to ensure health checks survive admin failures. It is monitored by VeroGuard's health watchdog.

- **Liveness Probe** — `GET /health` returns service status
- **Readiness Probe** — `GET /ready` checks database connectivity and returns 503 if unavailable
- **Guardian Status API** — `GET /api/guardian/status` exposes VeroGuard daemon running state

See `health_service/app.py` for the implementation and `health_service/runner.py` for the standalone Waitress WSGI runner.

## AI Infrastructure

### UnifiedLLM Gateway

The `UnifiedLLM` class in `agent_matrix/engine.py` provides a single entry point for all LLM interactions across the system. It supports:

- **9 AI Providers:** DashScope, OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, SiliconFlow, Google Gemini, xAI Grok, Zhipu GLM, KIMI
- **Dual Resolution:** By `provider_model_id` (recommended) or legacy `provider + model`
- **Client Caching:** 5-minute TTL cached OpenAI client instances, thread-safe
- **API Key Resolution:** Priority chain — `provider_api_keys` table (encrypted), environment variable, `system_config` table
- **Streaming Support:** `chat_stream()` with automatic token usage tracking
- **Tool Calling:** Native `chat_with_tools()` for function-calling agents
- **Unified Logging:** All calls write to `agent_token_logs` + `agent_token_daily`

### AI Budget Gate

Process-level rate limiting and daily token budget enforcement:

| Control | Default | Configurable |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Daily token cap | 2,000,000 tokens | `ai_budget_daily_tokens` in `system_config` |
| Rate limit | 30 calls/60s | `ai_rate_max_calls` + `ai_rate_window_sec` |
| Fail-open | Yes | Read failures allow calls through |

### LLM Quotas

Fine-grained quota management via `llm_quotas` table with priority: user > model > module > global. Each quota supports daily limits and rate limits independently.

**Extended Agents** (auto-registered): Supply Chain (1688 sourcing), Chatbot, Automation, Health Check, CMS, Cleaner

### Agent Discussion v2.0

Four-stage collaborative discussion protocol for complex tasks:
- **Planner** — Generates initial execution plan with task decomposition
- **Reviewer** — Critiques the plan for completeness and correctness
- **Planner (Revise)** — Revises the plan based on review feedback
- **Decider** — Final approval or rejection with reasoning

### Agent Execution

- **Parallel dispatch:** Sub-tasks execute via `ThreadPoolExecutor` with 300s timeout fuse
- **Deep mode:** Enhanced reasoning with multi-step chain-of-thought
- **Image mode:** Automatic image processing pipeline injection
- **Self-critique:** Agents self-score output quality; retry up to 3 times if confidence < 0.7
- **Cross-check:** Optional peer review by another sub-agent
- **Intent routing:** Keyword template + chat/tool intent classification
- **LLM Response Cache:** Session summary caching with automatic TTL and capacity limits

See [agent_matrix/ARCHITECTURE.md](agent_matrix/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed design and [agent_matrix/README.md](agent_matrix/README.md) for tools reference.
